  This is the source index.html template for Vite.
  
  During build (npm run build), Vite processes this file and:
  1. Resolves the /src/main.tsx script reference
  2. Bundles all JS/TS and CSS into hashed files in dist/assets/
  3. Rewrites script and link tags to reference the bundled assets
  4. Applies the base path (/zakat-calculator/) to all asset URLs
  
  The final build output in dist/index.html will have:
  - <script src="/zakat-calculator/assets/index-[hash].js">
  - <link href="/zakat-calculator/assets/index-[hash].css">
  
  No /src/ paths exist in the production build.
